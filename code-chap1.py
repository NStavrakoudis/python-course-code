# This program sets the variable a_string to "Hello World! " and then prints it.
# Then, it creats another variable, another_string and sets it to 
# "My name is another_string". This variable is also printed.
# As we saw, strings are defined within quotation marks, single or double.
# The variable strings_together is equal to a_string PLUS another_string
# The variable strings_together is also printed.
# After, a variable named b_string is set to "Hello ". This variable is 
# repeated 5 times, and the result is printed.

a_string = "Hello World! "
print(a_string)

another_string = "My name is another_string"
print(another_string)

strings_together = a_string + another_string
print(strings_together) 

b_string = "Hello "
